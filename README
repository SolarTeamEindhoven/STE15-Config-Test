# README #

This is the base project for all LPC1769 based micro controller boards for the solar car. It is not meant to be used directly, but instead should be forked into a board specific repository. Any changes in this base project can than easily be reflected in all forkes of this project.

To generate the documentation, run doxygen in the same folder where this readme is located with dgconfig as config file.
